{ Description: Feed new data to the MP3 decoder and optionally convert it
               to PCM data.
  Parameters: Stream handle,a pinter to the MP3 data,size of the MP3 buffer,
              a pointer to a buffer for the PCM data or NULL,the size of
              the PCM buffer in bytes,a pointer to return the number of
  d->ostart            converted bytes.
  Return value: PDMP3_OK or an error.
